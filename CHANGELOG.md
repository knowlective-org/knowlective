# Changelog

Notable changes to KNOWLECTIVE, newest first. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Until 1.0.0, a MINOR version (0.**x**.0) may contain changes that need attention when updating; they're listed under **Upgrade notes**. From 1.0.0 on, those come only with a MAJOR version: removed or renamed environment variables, database migrations that need manual steps, incompatible changes to `/api/v1`, and higher minimum Node.js or PostgreSQL versions.

Add each change under "Unreleased" as it's made. `pnpm release <version>` turns that section into the release's.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Next.js 16.3.1 → 16.4.3 (fixes several unauthenticated remote code execution advisories, among them one in the image optimization endpoint), nodemailer 10.2.1, Prisma 7.10.1, and patched indirect dependencies (Tiptap, ProseMirror, DOMPurify, sharp and others). `pnpm audit --prod` is down to one low-severity advisory (KaTeX through Mermaid, not fixable within Mermaid's range yet)
- Security headers on every response: framing by the site itself only, no MIME sniffing, `base-uri` / `object-src` restricted, Referer limited to the origin for other sites, camera / microphone / location / payment APIs off. The admin console keeps its stricter ones
- Reading attachments' text (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) stops at 64 MB unpacked, so a "zip bomb" can't exhaust the server's memory
- `pnpm check:auth`: fails when a Server Action or Route Handler doesn't check access, or app code bypasses the network policy. `pnpm security:scan`: that, `pnpm audit`, gitleaks, and (optionally) trivy on the image


### Changed

- Adding members to a group in the admin console: suggestions while typing, by display name or email address; several people can be picked (shown as badges) and added at once

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- The first version: a self-hostable document and knowledge sharing tool with a block editor and real-time collaborative editing.
  - Knowledge roots and page trees, personal "My pages", group permissions (view / edit / manage), publishing pages to the internet, page locks, history with restore and masking, trash
  - Editor: Markdown, Word and text import, attachments, PDF viewer, Mermaid diagrams, link previews, video embeds, child page lists, tables and boards; Markdown and PDF export
  - Full-text search (pages and attachment contents, with an encrypted index) and search by meaning (on the server)
  - Login with passwords, passkeys and single sign-on (OpenID Connect); invitations and self-registration; password reset
  - Admin console with roles, groups, audit log, IP and network restrictions, email, file storage, theme, site name and logo, and version information
  - Public API with personal API keys (pages as Markdown)
  - Encryption of page content, history, attachments, search index, email addresses and the audit log; the bundled PostgreSQL is encrypted as a whole (pg_tde)
  - Docker Compose / Podman installation (`install.sh`)
